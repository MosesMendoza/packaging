# Rake Task to dynamically create a Jenkins job to model the
# pl:jenkins:uber_build set of tasks in a Matrix job where each cell is an
# individual build to be run. This would be nice if we only had to create one job,
# but alas, we're actually creating three jobs.
# 1) a packaging job that builds the packages
#                     |
#                     V
# 2) a repo creation job that creates repos from those packages
#                     |
#                     V
# 3) (optional) a job to proxy the downstream job passed in via DOWNSTREAM_JOB
