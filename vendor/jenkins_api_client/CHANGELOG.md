upcoming
--------

v0.12.1  [25-JUN-2013]
----------------------
* Fixed a bug where the SSL support was not working properly with Ruby
  1.8.7/JRuby 1.6. Credit: @brettporter (For more info:
  https://github.com/arangamani/jenkins_api_client/pull/85)

v0.12.0  [18-JUN-2013]
----------------------
* Authentication is now optional as not all Jenkins instances have
  authentication enabled by default. Credit: @dougforpres
* Ability to retrieve build details so that more than just (`lamp color`) is
  available. Credit: @dougforpres
* Ability to retrieve build test-results for those builds that have them.
  Credit: @dougforpres
* Option to follow any 301/302 responses. This allows POST to build to follow
  the redirect and end up with a 200 response. Credit: @dougforpres
* Minor change to the POST requests handling where jenkins instances with a
  proxy returns 411 if no form data is specified. Fixed by sending an empty
  hash. Credit: @dougforpres
* As of Jenkins release 1.519, the job build returns a 201 code instead of 302.
  This was resulting in an exception and the exception handling is modified to
  handle this condition.
* The jobs that are not built yet have a new color (`notbuilt`) in the recent
  version of jenkins (> 1.517) which resulted in `invalid` status. This is fixed.
